Login Controller 
----------------

For some reason this controller is particularly hard to test. I cannot seem to get the promises to resolve in tests.

    describe 'Controller: LoginCtrl', ->

load the controller's module
      
      beforeEach module 'weddingWallApp'


instantiate all the dependencies

      LoginCtrl = {}
      scope = {}
      User = {}
      $httpBackend = {}
      $routeParams = {}
      $rootScope = {}

hook dependencies into controller being tested

      # Initialize the controller and a mock scope
      beforeEach inject ($controller, _$rootScope_, _User_, _$routeParams_, _$httpBackend_) ->
        # $location = _$location_
        $httpBackend = _$httpBackend_
        $rootScope = _$rootScope_
        $routeParams = _$routeParams_
        User = _User_
        
        $routeParams.userId = 12345
        $httpBackend.whenGET('/api/users/12345').respond(user12345)
        scope = $rootScope.$new()

        user12345 = 
          _id: 12345
          username: 'Alan Pies'

        LoginCtrl = $controller 'LoginCtrl', {
          $scope: scope
        }
    
        $httpBackend.flush()

I cannot get the stupid promises to resolve in order to test the controller. this
forces me into the cheap toBeDefined() copout

      it 'has assigned the logged in user to the $rootscope', ->
        # user12345 = 
        #   _id: 12345
        #   username: 'Alan Pies'
        expect($rootScope.currentUser).toBeDefined()
